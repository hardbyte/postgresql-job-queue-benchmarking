"""Replica lifecycle: start / stop / restart / kill by instance_id.

The pool is the harness-side handle that destructive phase types
(kill-worker, stop-worker, rolling-replace in #174 step 4+) act on.
Today only `run_one_system` touches it — it starts N replicas up front,
watches them during phases, and terminates them at the end. The pool
keeps the *intended* state per instance (running vs. deliberately
stopped) so a surprise exit during a phase can be distinguished from an
exit the scenario itself asked for:

    pool.stop_worker(0, signal=signal.SIGTERM)   # graceful
    pool.kill_worker(1)                          # SIGKILL
    pool.start_worker(0)                         # restart replica 0

The launcher-level machinery (`_launch_one_replica`) stays in
``orchestrator.py``; this module holds only the pool logic and owns the
closure the pool uses to create new replicas on demand. That indirection
is what makes the unit tests possible: a test can pass in a fake
``launch_fn`` and assert the state-machine transitions without needing
Docker or a Postgres.
